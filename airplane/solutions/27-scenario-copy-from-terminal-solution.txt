SCENARIO: COPY FROM TERMINAL TO BUFFER - SOLUTION
==================================================

1. Terminal shows output you need. Enter normal mode.
   Ctrl-\ Ctrl-n

2. Find the text with search
   /pattern
   (then n/N to navigate matches)

3. Yank 3 lines to register t
   "t3yy
   (or: V2j"ty for visual selection)

4. Switch to your code buffer
   Ctrl-w w       (cycle windows)
   or: :b filename
   or: Ctrl-^     (alternate buffer)

5. Paste from register t
   "tp
   (or in insert mode: Ctrl-r t)
