ALTERNATE BUFFER - SOLUTION
===========================

| Goal                              | Keys/Command      |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Switch to alternate buffer        | Ctrl-^  or  :b#   |
| What register holds alt filename? | "#                |

Note: Ctrl-^ is super useful for toggling between two files
      Also works as Ctrl-6 on some keyboards

The alternate buffer is the last buffer you were editing.
