TERMINAL FIND MOTIONS - SOLUTION
================================

1. Jump to next 'e' on this line
   fe

2. Jump to character before next ':'
   t:

3. Jump back to previous '/'
   F/

4. Repeat last find motion
   ;

5. Repeat last find motion backwards
   ,

6. Yank from cursor to next '"'
   yf"

7. Delete from cursor to (not including) next ','
   dt,

Summary:
  f = find (on the character)
  t = till (before the character)
  F = find backwards
  T = till backwards
  ; = repeat forward
  , = repeat backward

These work with operators:
  df. = delete to and including next .
  yt) = yank to (not including) next )
