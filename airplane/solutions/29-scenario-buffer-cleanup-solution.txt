SCENARIO: BUFFER CLEANUP - SOLUTION
===================================

1. List all buffers
   :ls
   (or :buffers)

2. Close buffer #3
   :bd 3
   (or :3bd)

3. Close all buffers except current
   :%bd | e#

   Breakdown:
   :%bd  - delete all buffers
   |     - then
   e#    - reopen alternate (which was current)

   (Some setups have :BufOnly or :Bonly plugin command)

4. Close current buffer but keep window open
   :bp | bd#

   Breakdown:
   :bp   - go to previous buffer
   |     - then
   bd#   - delete alternate buffer (which was current)

   This keeps the window with the previous buffer showing.
