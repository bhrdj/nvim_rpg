SCENARIO: SYSTEM CLIPBOARD INTEGRATION - SOLUTION
=================================================

PART A: Copy code to share in Slack

1. Select a function with visual line mode
   V
   (then j/k to extend selection, or use motion like }})

2. Yank to system clipboard
   "+y


PART B: Paste from web into nvim

1. (You copied text from browser with Ctrl-C)

2. In nvim normal mode, paste from clipboard
   "+p

3. In nvim insert mode, paste from clipboard
   Ctrl-r +


Bonus: To paste without triggering autoindent issues:
   :set paste
   "+p
   :set nopaste

Or use Ctrl-r Ctrl-o + in insert mode (literal paste)
