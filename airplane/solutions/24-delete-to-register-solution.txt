DELETE TO REGISTER - SOLUTION
=============================

| Goal                              | Keys    |
|-----------------------------------|---------|
| Delete line into register d       | "ddd    |
| Delete word into register w       | "wdw    |
| Delete without affecting registers| "_d     |

Pattern: "{register}{operator}{motion}

The black hole register "_ is useful when you want to delete
something without losing what's in your unnamed register.

Example workflow:
  yy       -> yank a line
  "_dd     -> delete current line (yank preserved!)
  p        -> paste the originally yanked line
