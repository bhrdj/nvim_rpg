BUFFER SYMBOLS - SOLUTION
=========================

| Symbol | Meaning                              |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| %      | Current buffer (in current window)   |
| #      | Alternate buffer (last edited)       |
| a      | Active (loaded and visible)          |
| h      | Hidden (loaded but not visible)      |
| +      | Modified (has unsaved changes)       |
| -      | Cannot be modified (readonly)        |
| =      | Readonly buffer                      |

Example :ls output:
  1  h   "file1.txt"         line 1
  2 %a + "file2.txt"         line 42
  3 #h   "file3.txt"         line 10

This shows: file2 is current (%a), modified (+), file3 is alternate (#)
