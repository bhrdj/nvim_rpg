TERMINAL LINE OPERATIONS - SOLUTION
===================================

1. Yank this line only
   yy

2. Yank from here to line 60
   y60G

3. Yank from here to end of terminal buffer
   yG

4. Yank from line 1 to here
   ygg

5. Yank 20 lines starting from cursor
   20yy  (or y19j)

6. Go to line 100
   100G  (or :100)

7. Yank from here to a search match
   y/pattern

   This yanks from cursor to (not including) the match.

   Or use visual mode:
   v/pattern then y
