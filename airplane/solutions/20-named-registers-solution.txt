USING NAMED REGISTERS - SOLUTION
================================

| Goal                              | Keys       |
|-----------------------------------|------------|
| Yank line into register a         | "ayy       |
| Append to register a              | "Ayy       |
| Paste from register a             | "ap        |
| Paste from register a (insert)    | Ctrl-r a   |
| View all registers                | :reg       |

Key insight: Capital letter APPENDS to the register!
- "ayy  -> replaces register a
- "Ayy  -> appends to register a

This is powerful for collecting multiple pieces of text.

:reg also shows as :registers or :di (display)
