SCENARIO: GRAB CODE BLOCK FROM CLAUDE - SOLUTION
================================================

1. Exit terminal insert mode
   Ctrl-\ Ctrl-n

2. Search for the opening ``` of the code block
   /```  (or ?``` to search backwards)

3. Move down one line (to first code line)
   j

4. Start visual line selection
   V

5. Search forward for closing ```
   /```

6. Move up one line (exclude the ```)
   k

7. Yank the selection
   y

8. Open new file in split
   :vs newfile.py  (or :sp newfile.py)

9. Paste the code
   p

One-liner alternative (after step 3):
   V/```-1 then y

   The -1 would need to be after the search, so:
   V then /``` then k then y
