WINDOW MAXIMIZE/RESTORE - SOLUTION
==================================

| Goal                              | Keys                      |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Maximize current window height    | Ctrl-w _                  |
| Maximize current window width     | Ctrl-w |                  |
| Maximize both (full screen)       | Ctrl-w _  then  Ctrl-w |  |
| Restore all windows to equal size | Ctrl-w =                  |
| Open current buffer in new tab    | :tab split                |
| Close current tab (return)        | :tabclose  or  gt/:q      |

Bonus Answer:
- Ctrl-w _ and Ctrl-w | maximize the current window but keep
  other windows visible (just very small, 1 line/column)
- :only CLOSES all other windows entirely, leaving just the
  current one. You'd need to reopen them with :split/:vsplit

Tip: The tab method (:tab split) is great for temporary "zoom"
because closing the tab returns you to your exact split layout.
