SCENARIO: COMPARE TWO OUTPUTS - SOLUTION
========================================

1. Exit terminal mode
   Ctrl-\ Ctrl-n

2. Find first output, yank it
   /output1_pattern
   V (select lines) y
   (or yank to register: "ay)

3. Switch to buffer, paste it
   Ctrl-w w
   p

4. Switch back to terminal
   Ctrl-w w  (or Ctrl-^)

5. Find second output, yank it
   /output2_pattern
   V (select lines) y

6. Create vertical split in buffer area
   Ctrl-w w  (go to buffer)
   :vs  (or Ctrl-w v)

7. Paste second output
   p

8. Now you can visually compare side-by-side
   Use Ctrl-w h/l to switch between them
   Use :diffthis in each window for diff mode
