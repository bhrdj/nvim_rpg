## Game Log

### Session Start
*The adventure begins...*

You stand at the entrance of the legendary Nvim Dungeon. Tales speak of powerful editing magics hidden within - commands that can reshape text with a thought, navigate vast documents in an instant, and transform chaos into order.

But first, you must learn to walk before you can run.

The entrance hall stretches before you. The air smells of parchment and possibility. Somewhere deeper in the dungeon, you hear the distant clatter of mechanical keyboards.
